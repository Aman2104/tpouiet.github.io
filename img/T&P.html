                It seems like it was just yesterday that I nervously headed to the Kurukshetra UIET hallway for the recording.
                All I dreamed of was getting good rankings from here.I never expected UIET Kurukshetra to improve and improve 
                me so much.With the world class facilities of UIET Kurukshetra and The approachable teachers were always helping 
                and motivating me to reach new heights every day. I would also like to mention the various clubs and societies,
                seniors and juniors who have helped me grow both professionally and socially. I would like to express my sincere
                gratitude to everyone who has been directly or indirectly involved in my journey. I achieved the highest ranking
                in college on Amazon. I can confidently say that this was only possible thanks to the environment and the various
                resources provided by UIET Kurukshetra. Besides that, studying at such a prestigious institution taught me to 
                be compassionate and stay grounded in life. I vow to do my best and bring glory to my alma mater.

                The reminiscence of my journey at UIET Kurukshetra never cease to exhilarate me.
                The ambience of the Institute, the pedagogical methods followed, the support provided 
                by the professors at each and every facet, the avenue of opportunities for all round 
                development of the student are magnificent. In these years of my college life, I have 
                experienced the elegance of Computer science which eventually landed me in Hexaware. 
                I was also a member of E-cell, UIET. I have indulged myself in various cultural activities
                too. Above all these, the crucial learning during this period is to find the balance
                between various activities in my plate. If I come across any scenario that challenges 
                me in future, I will definitely look back at the life lessons of my alma mater and
                extract the zeal to come out of it in flying colors. The four years spent here certainly
                 paved a path for all the coming years of my career.
